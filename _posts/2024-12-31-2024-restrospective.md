2024 Retrospective
=========================

Let's kick this off with the obligatory GitHub contributions chart.

December looks like a barren wasteland out there as I mostly paid off some of my sleep debt, and didn't end up tinkering too much.

## Monthly Retrospective Archive

{% include toc.html year="2024" monthly="true" %}

## Other Random Scribblings

{% include toc.html year="2024" %}

Alas, I didn't scribble as much compared to last year. Which is precisely the reason why I don't really do new years resolutions.

## Stronghold Crusader: Conspiracy Theory Edition

Firefly dropped a new video about Crusader History a few weeks ago, which made people speculate about whether the Definitive Edition might finally be in the works.

Quite funny how I was rambling about the Definitive Edition of Stronghold exactly a year ago in 2023's  great retrospective, and here I am doing it again.

I am slowly but surely turning into a wise old man. Well, the wise part remains to be seen of course.

## 2025 .plan

Pretty much everything that I listed last year and didn't really manage to get done.

Last by not least, let's get ready for season 5 of 2020.

Until next year, as ***server said***: `END OF LINE`!
