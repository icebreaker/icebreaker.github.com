2018 Shakedown
==============
Another glorious year is behind us and I'm here typing up a short _summary_ of what I've been
hacking on during the year.

All that being said, let me start by sharing the mandatory **"last year in commits"** chart generated
by GitHub.

![](/media/github/2018.png)

Sakura
------
I've been a long time [terminator][3] user, but as the years went by it got slower and slower,
and buggier. Because of this, I ended up forking [sakura][4] and adding a couple of missing
features like borderless window, etc.

Parsello
--------
Parsello is a _portable_ single file parser/lexer/tokenizer written in ANSI C (89).

### Facts
* minimalist API
* small and lightweight (~ 450 LOC)
* reasonably fast
* zero copy and zero memory allocations
* no dependencies (C std only)
* compiles on your toaster (C89 and up)
* doesn't touch the "source input" string
* single file

```c
#define PRS_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "prs.h"

const char *s = "...";

...

prs_context_t ctx;
prs_token_t token;

prs_init(&ctx, s);

while(prs_parse(&ctx, &token))
  printf("'%.*s' of type %s on line %d\n",
         token->len, token->s, prs_token_type_to_str(token), token->line);

...
```

You can check it out over [here][5].

O2D3M
-----
This project started as a plugin for [Tiled][6], but then I turned it into its
own standalone command line utility and made it work with a Wavefront OBJ file,
rather than a Tiled _map_.

What it does? Well, it takes a Wavefront OBJ file, parses out all the meshes
and turns them into brushes and entities thus producing a DOOM3 map, which
then can be _compiled_ via _dmap_.

You can learn more about it over [here][7].

Testa
-----
Made some improvements to Testa, my _portable_ single file _"(unit) test framework"_ for C/C++.

```c
#include "testa.h"

int sample_magic_numbers(void)
{
	int a = 42;

	TESTA_ASSERT_EQUAL(a, 13);

	return 0;
}

int sample_more_magic_numbers(void)
{
	int b = 42;

	TESTA_ASSERT_EQUAL(b, 42);

	return 0;
}

int sample_that_will_be_skipped(void)
{
	TESTA_SKIP();

	TESTA_ASSERT_NOT_EQUAL(13, 13);

	return 0;
}

int sample_is_not_null(void)
{
	int *p = NULL;

	TESTA_ASSERT(p != NULL);

	return 0;
}

int sample_pointer_equality(void)
{
	int *p = NULL;

	TESTA_ASSERT_EQUAL(p, NULL);

	return 0;
}

int sample_swap_numbers(void)
{
	int a = 13, b = 14, tmp;

	tmp = a;
	a = b;
	b = a;

	TESTA_ASSERT_EQUAL(tmp, 13);
	TESTA_ASSERT_EQUAL(a, 14);
	TESTA_ASSERT_EQUAL(b, 13);

	return 0;
}

TESTA_SUITE_BEGIN
	TESTA_GROUP_BEGIN("sample test group")
		TESTA_TEST(sample_magic_numbers)
		TESTA_TEST(sample_more_magic_numbers)
		TESTA_TEST(sample_that_will_be_skipped)
		TESTA_TEST(sample_is_not_null)
		TESTA_GROUP_BEGIN("sample sub test group")
			TESTA_TEST(sample_pointer_equality)
			TESTA_TEST(sample_swap_numbers)
		TESTA_GROUP_END
	TESTA_GROUP_END
TESTA_SUITE_END
```

And the results can be seen on the screenshot below.

LSL
---
While **LSL** (_Lua Shading Language_) is not something I ended up _releasing_ just yet,
it was a fun little experiment composed of devising a _pure_ Lua based DSL to output
GLSL 1.2.

![](/media/2018/lsl.png)

The idea would be that one has "different" backends that can output HLSL, GLSL, MLSL, etc
from a common source language, without abusing a _preprocessor_ or writing an actual _parser_.

This is very much inspired by some of the [work][2] of [Petri Hakkinen][1].

Sobinka
-------
Sobinka is a portable 2D game engine and framework written in C and it started as a small
experimental sandbox that I've started building to test out a couple of the _game ideas_
that I've been toying around with the past 2 years.

It's made of a _thin_ shell written in C that exposes relatively low level functionality
via an _immediate mode_ Lua API, which then can be used to build a game or
even a regular desktop app.

![](/media/2018/sobinka.png)

Version _1.0.0_ will support Linux, Windows, macOS (OSX) and HTML5 (web) via emscripten.

```lua
local tiled = import 'com.tiled'

local state = state or {}

function soa_on_init()
	soa_window_set_title('Binding')

	state.texture_id = soa_renderer_texture_load('textures/jerom')
	soa_renderer_set_texture(state.texture_id)

	state.map = tiled.find('maps/e1m1')
end

function soa_on_frame(dt)
	soa_renderer_clear(SOA_RENDERER_CLEAR_COLOR)

	tiled.draw(state.map)

    soa_renderer_draw(0, 0, 64, 64, 128, 128, 64, 64)

	soa_renderer_flush()

	if soa_input_mouse_clicked(SOA_MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT) then
		soa_message_send('mouse_clicked', 'message mouse')
	end
end

function soa_on_message(id, message)
	print('on message', id, message)
end

function soa_on_quit()
	print('on quit')
end
```

I intend to post some more in-depth information about some of the technical
aspects and decisions, in 2019; most likely after the first _public release_.
