# Lomo: Smena Symbol

By a series of rather unexpected events, I found myself in the possession of an ancient [Lomo: Smena Symbol][camera] camera, which seems to be in an almost pristine condition, on the outside at least!

I grew out of my habit to take everything apart at around age 13 or thereabouts, and I am to report that I managed to resist the temptation of verifying if time was indeed kind to it on the inside as well.

Sadly, the manual was lost in time. Fortunately, managed to track down a scanned copy of the English version of the manual at [lomography.com][manual].

I decided to [host a copy][pdf] of it on this blog, just in case the original might disappear for a reason or another in the not so near future. One can never be too precautious in this day and age.

Naturally, I also do not happen to have any *rolls of film* laying around by any chance; who does in the year of 2025, really? Not a great many people, I am sure of that much.

Based on my superficial and cursory research, rather unsurprisingly I might add, the recommended options in terms of brand: seem to be [Kodak 200][kodak200] for color, and [Kodak 400TX][kodak400tx] for black and white.

I'll have to buy some and try it out, then post the results of course; but, as per usual, I'd rather not make any promises that I can't keep.

This is the kind of stuff that would warrant having *yet another retro focused* YouTube channel.
