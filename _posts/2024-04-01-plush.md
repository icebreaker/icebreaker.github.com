# Plush

If you ever used [Winamp][winamp] in the 90s or early 2000s for that matter, then you might have semi-accidentally stumbled upon the mysterious word of *"[Plush][plush]"*.

And, even if you did not for some peculiar reason or another, then you most certainly have seen the "Credits" in the "About Winamp" dialog.

Alright, so what is [Plush][plush] exactly? [Plush][plush] is tiny real time software renderer written in the mid-to-late 90s by [Justin "time compiler" Frankel][jfrankel] of [Winamp][winamp] ([Nullsoft][nullsoft]) fame.

## Demo

I thought to myself that it would be fun little side-project to turn it into a single file library, then compile it down to web assembly via [Emscripten][emscripten] and see how it fares in a relatively modern browser.

It's worth pointing out the fact that I refrained from making any significant changes or optimizations, other than fixing a few compiler warnings, so that everything compiles in a relatively tidy fashion. I hate compiler warnings flooding the screen.

Only something written in C can still compile after being untouched for so many years. This is a fact, of life, and it's not something up for a debate. Imagine having to compile anything written in C++ that is more than a few years old. Good luck with that. C++ rots at an incredible pace, in fact the more modern, the faster and more accelerated is the rot.

As per usual, many kudos to [Suzanne][suzanne] for putting up with me and volunteering as a test subject.
