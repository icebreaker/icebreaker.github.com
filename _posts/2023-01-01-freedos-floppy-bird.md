FreeDOS and Floppy Bird
=========================

Going to start the year off with a rather unexpected banger. Many moons ago, during the great year of 2014, I released [Floppy Bird][floppybird], a boot-able clone of the infamous [Flappy Bird][flappybird] written in 16-bit assembly.

A while later, I added an M$-DOS compatible version in the form of a .COM executable weighting a whopping *8704 bytes*, or *8.5 kilobytes*. Could have probably saved a few more bytes, oh well!

Needless to say it has gotten a fair bit of attention in its early days, but never would have ever imagined that it would end up being bundled as a game with [FreeDOS][freedos].

I only found out about this last night and absolutely by accident, when YouTube ended up recommending me the official [FreeDOS channel][freedosyoutubechannel].

What a totallly unexpected surprise. Starting the year off on the right foot, amirite?
