# La luna del cacciatore

If you have watched [Alien vs. Predator][avp] from 2004,, then you surely will remember the now infamous *Hunter's Moon* scene, which happens during an exchange between [Alexa "Lex" Woods][lexwoods], and one of the Italian archaeologists, professor [Sebastian De Rosa][profderosa].

If none of this rings a bell to you, not to worry, because I did all the hard work for your pleasure and entertainment. Please enjoy the following short clip, which should classify as fair-use under the rule of the law. Or at least that's what I like to tell myself.

What better time to dedicate a post to ***AVP***, than on the day of the *super-moon* itself.

How silly of me, I almost forgot to share the trailer in all the excitement.

I do realize that many people are not too keen on the idea of a shared [Alien][alien] and [Predator][predator] universe, but I am not one of those people, obviously!

Take a look at what mighty [Ridley Scott][ridleyscott] himself had to say about it all. I guess it's totally fair to say that he's not that big of a fan of it either.

One thing that was always rather bemusing to me is how some of the critics brought up the subject of cultural and historical inaccuracies. Makes one wonder, which part of *science fiction* don't these folks understand? This line of reasoning is not unique to this franchise by any means of course.

At any rate, now it's time for me call it a night, and re-watch the movie for the Nth time.
