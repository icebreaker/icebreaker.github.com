2023 January Retrospective
=========================

January as usual is the so called trial-month of the year, is all said and done already. It truly flew by and as usual I didn't get all that much done. Which is to be expected.

I do have two posts in the oven coming up in February if all goes well. One about creating normal maps from diffuse maps and another about USD, which I have been promising to write about for quite some time now, but never really found the time to do so until now.

One of my semi-unofficial new years resolutions was to write more in addition to my regular monthly retrospectives, which I intend to keep, albeit not religiously of course.

In other news, May can't come soon enough for *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* to drop.
