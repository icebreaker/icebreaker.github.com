2023 March Retrospective
=========================

March is over and I still haven't gotten around refining my post about [USD][usd], but do intend to do that in the next few days given that all goes well. Trying real hard not to make it too contentious or critical, which is an easier thing said than done all things considered.

Other than that, I didn't get to focus on anything else on my long list of items that I keep in my giant back-burner. I truly hope that April will be a whole lot less of a hectic month and I'll have something even remotely interesting to share.

## The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

It looks like I ended up posting about Tears of the Kingdom in both January and February. It might be become a *permanent column* in these monthly retrospectives; or the very least until the launch day, which is not very far away at this point, and seriously can't come soon enough.

You can find the newest whopping *13-minute-long* gameplay trailer below, presented by none other than [Eiji Aonuma][aonuma] himself, who happens to be the producer of the game.

There are a lot of naysayers of course, many among them with their usual complaints about weapon durability and the whole thing being just a glorified DLC selling for a whopping $70 and so forth.

But, all of them will buy the game anyway, they just like to play the role of a glorious keyboard warrior in the various comment sections across the information super highway.

If you happen to be one of those people who doesn't like or want any spoilers at all before release, then of course please resist all temptations by the devil and avoid clicking on the play button above.
