2017 Shakedown
==============
Oh, it's _dat time_ of the year again. All in all, it was a good year, but aren't they all good?

To put things into perspective, here are some charts *generated* by [GitHub][0].

#### 2017

#### 2016

#### 2015

A tad bit less _contributions_ this year, compared to 2016, but as you can see on the chart it has been
"more concentrated" (meaning, more dark green spots).

Fz2D
----
[Fz2D][8] received a batch of small updates, but it still didn't graduate from alpha to
beta, like I would have hoped.

With the advent of ES5 and ES6 being rolled out in all major browsers, I feel like the 5
minutes of fame of CoffeeScript _expired_ and we can start writing slightly more structured
things in pure JS, without resorting to all those 1998 style tricks.

All that being said, most likely I will "transpile" the code-base into _modern JS_ with a tool
like [decaffeinate][10] and then of course clean it by hand as necessary.

Feel free to take a peek at the documentation available over [here][9].

Simon8
------
In other news, I _ported_ my [Chip 8][2] _emulator_ (_read: interpreter_) to JavaScript via [emscripten][1].

You can check it out over [here][3].

Testa
-----
I also released Testa which is a _portable_ single file _"(unit) test framework"_ for C/C++.

You can check it out over [here][4].

ASMToy
------
This was something that I wanted to try out for quite some time now.

ASMToy is _dosbox_ compiled to JavaScript running a modified [Flat Assembler][5] IDE for
DOS.

The changes do not let you reboot or escape the confines of the IDE.

In effect, it lets you play with 16-bit _assembly_ in DOS, right in your browser.

Doom Brush
----------
This has been inspired by [Joshua Skelly's][12] work, who is writing a small tool that
can "transpile" a TMX Map (produced by the [Tiled][13] 2D map editor) into a Quake _map_.

In my case, I had two goals:

1. "transpile" a Wavefront OBJ model file into brushes and entities
2. write a Tiled plugin exporter plugin, that can export "object layers" as brushes
and entities; with the brushes being constructed from the "polygon" objects defined
within the editor itself (should be reasonably simple ..)

Managed to _achieve_ the first goal and I am quite happy with the _library_ I wrote,
but it still needs a little bit of clean-up, because some the of API is a bit
confusing at the moment.

![](/media/2017/db.png)

As far as the second goal is concerned, I managed to "sketch" out the skeleton of the
exporter plugin, but didn't get to implement any of the actual functionality.

I'll release the source code most likely sometime next year.

Nixel
-----
Yet again, my primary focus has been _Nixel_ which is the codename of the game engine
and framework I've been hacking on for ages.

This year, I managed to figure out a number of technical conundrums and investigated
which "GUI framework" to use for the _tools_. In the end, I just decided to
roll my own "Immediate Mode GUI" (IMGUI), because everything had too many dependencies
or some weird and intricate layout system.

For some time, I considered that perhaps Electron could be the answer, because now that
we have _flexbox_, one doesn't have to resort to "floating elements" and "tables" to make
reasonably _complicated_ layouts.

But in the end, it felt like pulling in way too many dependencies and that is something
that I am paying enormous amounts of attention to.

One of the primary problems of both closed and open source projects are dependencies.

If the dependencies are hard to _install_ or hard _build_ and not self-contained enough
to be _bundled_ with the project, then it becomes a nightmare to build and maintain
the project. In turn this will automatically increase the barrier of entry for _new_
contributors, as well as hinder porting and general maintenance over time.

I also decided to roll with JS as a scripting language, relying on the excellent
[Duktape][11], instead of Lua. We'll see how this will pan out in the long run,
but so far it appears that it will be "fast" enough and the GC can be kept under
control.

You have to realize that, we are talking about a very tight event loop, where every
millisecond is precious and one wants to waste as few as possible.

Next year, I'll try to delve into these things in a little bit more detail, so you
can expect more content from me, rather than the average of 1-2 posts per year,
which is nothing less than appalling if you ask me.

Nintendo Switch
---------------
Like millions of people around this piece of this of a rock floating in space, I got
a Nintendo Switch, shortly after its release, together with the [Wolf Link Amiibo][6].

Game                      | Medium    | Hours Played  | Notes |
------------------------- | ------    | ------------- | -----
The Legend of Zelda: BOTW | cartridge | 200+          | n/a
Kingdom                   | digital   | 30+           | n/a
Skyrim                    | digital   | 10+           | n/a
Snake Pass                | digital   | 2 or less     | n/a
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe       | digital   | 1 or less     | n/a
Oceanhorn                 | digital   | 1 or less     | n/a
Shephy                    | digital   | 1 or less     | n/a
Morphite                  | digital   | 1 or less     | n/a
Little Inferno            | digital   | 1 or less     | completed on PC
World of Goo              | digital   | 1 or less     | completed on PC
The Flame in The Flood    | digital   | 1 or less     | n/a

By the way, **NO**, I didn't lick the cartridge.

All I can say is that Nintendo did it again. If only Sony would have _invested_
slightly more in the PS Vita (which I also own), I think that this could have been
more of a _battle_, rather than just stealing the show without any competition.

The dual _function_ of the Switch is the prime thing that makes it apart and
contributed to its resounding success.

After all, we all know that the Switch was been [DOOMed][7] from the get go, right?

End

And here we are. Before I wrap this up though, my game of the year has been
The Legend of Zelda: BOTW, without any doubts. I mean, it's quite self evident
given the number of hours I sank into it.

Oh and also, after many years of using Meslo LG Mono as my primary font, a few
months ago I made the switch to IBM Plex Mono. So far so good, but it still
remains to be seen if I'll revert, because I am not totally convinced just yet.
