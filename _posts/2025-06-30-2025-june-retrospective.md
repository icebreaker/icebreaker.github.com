# 2025 June Retrospective

The first month of summer is all said and done. Lots of [complaints about the *heat*][canicule] as per usual; all of which I find quite amusing to be perfectly honest. I don't know about you, but back in the day, when I was all young and shit, it used to be so hot that one's feet would leave an imprint in the asphalt covering the sidewalk, not to mention that the grass was all burn out and yellow. We were just built different back then, to use an expression that the Gen-Z will be all too familiar with.

## Alien: Earth

I don't want to get my hopes too high for this one just yet, as it could turn out to be one of those shows that is canceled after only one season, but the anticipation is quite palpable; I think we can all agree on that, without getting into any egregious polemics.

## Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition

You'll have to bear with me yapping about the definitive edition for a little while longer as it should ship sometime in July.

## Conjuring: Final Rites

I was so *razzle-dazzled* by the latest entry in the [Final Destination][finaldestination] franchise that I forgot to even mention the final entry in the [Conjuring][conjuring] series in my May retrospective.

## Talent Poaching

Whenever the ugly specter of poaching talent raises its ugly head, the following famous or rather infamous e-mail exchange between the late Steve Jobs and his counterpart at Adobe is sure to make a timely appearance.

Look, I am not here to lecture anyone on the ethics or morals of actively recruiting from your so called competition; there are plenty of self-proclaimed guru types out there who have done that already, but I'll say this, if someone can be convinced to jump ship simply on the basis of higher pay, then it's also fair to assume that the person's heart wasn't in the right place to begin with.

That is not to say that generous compensation doesn't matter, but it most definitely loses it's so called potency above a certain threshold, or one would like to think that it does.

And by the by, there were no [100-million-sign-on-bonuses][100milsignonbonus] after all as it turns out. In fact not even close! This is why I always said that rumor control matters way more, than any form of marketing out there.

## Layoffs

The layoffs continue in full force with around **72,808** people losing their jobs in 2025 according to [Layoffs.fyi][layoffsfyi], and considering the fact that we are only half-way through the year, this number will very likely rise to as high as **100,000** by new years'.

I said this before, and I'll say it again, the so called recension hasn't even begun yet in earnest. But, when it does, it will make *2008-2009* seem like child's play, and might become the heir apparent to the [**"Great Depression"**][greatdepression] of the *1930s*.

## Monday Dad Joke

As I intend to continue with the new tradition established in May, I decided to up the level of cringe a tiny bit this time around.

> **Q**: Why did the *smartphone* go to the beach on a summer Monday?
>
> **A**: It wanted to catch some "cell-fies" in the sun!

Enjoy!
