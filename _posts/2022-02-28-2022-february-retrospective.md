2022 February Retrospective
===========================
Yet another month is behind me, but this one had a little bit more of a
significance, because it happened to be the month I gracefully did `age++` like
a true pro that I am.

So, what has transpired? Well, I know that I said that there won't be too many
side-projects to distract me from working on what I ended up calling the
`OLEN Games Toolkit`, BUT and that's a BIG but ...

Well, I decided to build a small boot-able as well as MS-DOS compatible
[Wordle][wordle] clone. I know, I know, isn't it a bit too late for that? Yes,
and no, because the hype didn't die out completely yet. And besides, I
really wanted to do something like this yet again, considering that the
last time I've done it, well it was was ages ago now, back in good old
2014 when I released [Floppy Bird][floppybird], my boot-able [Flappy
Bird][flappybird] clone.

In other news, also picked up work on the [USDZ][usdz] exporter that I've built a
proof of concept of late last year. This is written in C#, with no third party
dependencies and its primary purposes is to be used within Unity and to be
fully compatible with WebGL builds.

Once I have it in a good and usable shape, I'll write a dedicated post about
it, because the [USDZ][usdz] format, let's just say that it's one of the worst
formats out there. But more on that later, so don't drop your pants just yet.

Other than that, I also started to make some progress on the `foundation`
library of the `OLEN Games Toolkit`. Once again, more on that later, when I
actually have some juicy technical details to share.
