2023 February Retrospective
=========================

February came and went as well. I did manage to write about creating normal maps from diffuse maps, which you can read by clicking [here][creating-normal-maps]. The actual results turned out to be way better than I originally expected, considering that the entire process is not super complicated.

As always, I like to jump on the hype-train when new and shiny dank memes and such are being born, so I created a small `bookmarklet` that you can use to play snake on your GitHub contributions matrix.

If you fancy trying it out, you can find the instructions by heading over [here][githubsnake].

In other news, we got a brand new trailer for *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* this month; which of course has been analyzed to death by everybody and their grandmother called Zelda.
