# 2024 August Retrospective

I feel like this month's theme should have been easy to guess. I am talking about [Alien Romulus][alienromulus] of course. Haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but as an avid fan of the franchise is pretty high up on my  *to-watch-list*.

## Alien: Romulus

## Diablo: WebAssembly

A [WebAssembly][webassembly] port of [Diablo devolved][devolution] (a.k.a devolution) has made some rounds on the information-super-highway half-way through the month. So, I thought that I'd bring it up in case you missed it.

You can also try it out in a new tab by clicking over [here][diabloweb].

I ranted about this in the past, so I am not going to do it again; but, it's still quite interesting and strange to me that we do not see more action when it comes to [WebAssembly][webassembly] and games.

Can't say that I heard any good and sound arguments as to why this is, except random excuses that do not really carry much weight, as far as I am concerned.
