2022 November Retrospective
===========================

I accumulated quite a lot of repositories on [GitHub][github] over the years. Many are forks of ancient versions of libraries, which some people still tend of find and then attempt to use. Which of course is not a good idea for a number of reasons, but what can one do?

Well, one could go ahead and clean them up. Which is exactly what I started doing this month. There's still ways to go and more to nuke, but the process has started.

If I had a dollar for every email I have from someone trying to compile or use one of these ancient relics I would have been the one to buy Twitter.

By going through the list of repositories during the cleaning process, I also happened to stumble upon a few very old personal gems of mine that I have totally forgotten about.

## Qetesh

Qetesh is a tiny editor that let's you use Egyptian Hieroglyphs.

It can save/load from local storage and export as an image.

You can find it over [here][qetesh].

## Russian Flag Photo Filter

I know that given the current happenings and goings of the world this might not be the right time and place to resurface this in any capacity, but nonetheless I found it funny that this just laid there dormant for so many years.
