2022 May Retrospective
======================
May, didn't turn out to be as a productive month as I would have hoped when it comes to my personal projects, but still managed to get some stuff done.

Decided to take Niva a little bit further than I initially thought that I would, and ended up experimenting with a couple of features when it comes to the "preview" mode, which should allow one to build interactive more interactive "previews".

In the screenshot below you can see a small ray-casting experiment.

In other news, I also started looking into [libvterm][libvterm], because I am growing more and more frustrated with [libvte][libvte] and its maintainers' rather questionable decisions.

> **Fun fact**: [libvterm][libvterm] is also the "library" that vim uses for the built-in terminal that comes with vim 8.x and up.

Obviously, rolling with [libvterm][libvterm] and building another terminal emulator from scratch would add yet another distraction in terms of side projects, but I feel like it just has to be done for my own peace of mind.

That is all i got to share this month. Let's see what June brings. I can't believe that we are 6 months into the year already.
