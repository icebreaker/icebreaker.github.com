2015 Shakedown
==============
Another year passed and I didn't *honor* my promise about posting more on this blog.

Next year, I will try to post at least once every month and I feel like there will be
plenty of things to talk about :)

Before we proceed any further, one of the first (**NY**) changes you'll notice, is that this
blog has been moved over to [mihail.co](http://mihail.co). It's just a better and less confusing
domain with an easily pronounceable *name*. Everybody heard about
[Mihail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev) after all.

If you are subscribed to the blog via [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/mihailco), the old "feed" should continue to work as expected
and should require no changes, but those of you adventurous souls can subscribe to the
*new* [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/mihailco).

On a totally different note, I did *release* quite a few interesting projects this year, but as always,
not nearly enough to satisfy my ever growing hunger.

Without any further ado, down below, you can read about what kept my gray cells busy during the year.

Fz2D
----
[Fz2D](http://github.com/icebreaker/fz2d) is a 2D game engine and framework I released last year.

This year it received quite a few updates and got to version **0.0.2**, which means that it's
still *alpha* but at the same time it reached a certain level of *maturity*, so to speak.

Deermas, Bricks of Babel and Snakr are all powered by **Fz2D**.

Deermas, for instance, was *thrown* together in *one and a half* days. Obviously I did not create
the actual sprites and music, got them from [opengameart.org](http://opengameart.org), but still, it
felt quite nice, just be able to fit the parts together and get a *basic* game up and running in
practically no time at all.

The **API** is still not set in stone, but all in all it's quite consistent and doesn't try to
do more than it is absolutely necessary.

Feel free to take a peek at the documentation available over [here](http://szabster.net/fz2d/docs/).

Deermas
-------
A mini adventure game for [Maral](http://twitter.com/_maral).

Bricks of Babel
---------------
Bricks of Babel is a physics based tower building game. Initially built for [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com).

Simon8
------
Simon8 is a Chip 8 disassembler and emulator written in C.

![](/media/games/simon8.png)

This is something that I wanted to do for so long, but never really took the time to do it.
Here it is, full blown suite of tools composed of a disassembler and an emulator for the Chip 8.

The tools follow the \*nix principles and support pipes, as well as file arguments.

```bash
build/disasm roms/MAZE
cat roms/MAZE | build/disasm
```

```nasm
0x200: LD    I, 0x21E
0x202: RND  V2, 0x01
0x204: SE   V2, 0x01
0x206: LD    I, 0x21A
0x208: DRW  V0, V1, 0x04
0x20A: ADD  V0, 0x04
0x20C: SE   V0, 0x40
0x20E: JP   0x200
0x210: LD   V0, 0x00
0x212: ADD  V1, 0x04
0x214: SE   V1, 0x20
0x216: JP   0x200
0x218: JP   0x218
0x21A: LD   V0, V4
0x21C: CALL 0x010
0x21E: CALL 0x040
0x220: LD   V0, V1
```

You can find out more about it over
[here](http://github.com/icebreaker/simon8).

Snakr
-----
Snakr is a "Snake clone" with a twist. Initially built for [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com).

![](/media/games/snakr.png)

You can find out more about it over
[here](http://github.com/icebreaker/snakr). If you just want to play it, you
can do so by clicking [here](/snakr).

ZeeCraft
--------
ZeeCraft is a mini Minecraft clone in 588 lines of C.

![](/media/games/zeecraft.gif)

This was one of those *"because I can"* projects more than anything else and indeed managed
to do it in mere 588 lines.

#### Tech Details
The actual *world size* is `16x16x16` units (cubes) and there's no frustum culling, meaning
that the whole world is drawn each time, but at this scale it really doesn't matter.
It does have back-face culling though.

The various *block types* are *compiled display lists*.

To keep the amount of code within limits, it requires OpenGL 1.4 and relies on *fixed function*
pipeline only.

SDL is used for window management and input handling.

As an added bonus, the *world* is automatically persisted and loaded between runs.

You can find out more about it over
[here](http://github.com/icebreaker/zeecraft).

Floppy Bird
-----------
Floppy Bird is one of my most popular projects and this year it got a minor update.

It is now possible to compile it into a *DOS* compatible *.COM* executable, which then can run in
any *DOS* like environment.

You can find out more about it over
[here](http://github.com/icebreaker/floppybird).

2dimagefilter
-------------
I *forked* [2dimagefilter](https://code.google.com/p/2dimagefilter/) and removed all exotic *GUI*
crap, basically everything that wasn't *implemented* by Mono.

The command line interface is now usable on any platform where Mono is supported.

```bash
ImageResizer /load in.png /resize auto "XBR 4x(2,thresholds=0,vbounds=wrap)" /save out.png
```

You can find out more about it over
[here](http://github.com/icebreaker/2dimagefilter).

fastopen.vim
------------
fastopen.vim is a quick "file opener" using "dmenu". It is my very first **Vim plugin**.

![](/media/2015/fastopen.png)

You can find out more about it over
[here](http://github.com/icebreaker/fastopen.vim).

Nexeh
-----
Around a year ago, I had the idea of building an old-school first person shooter from scratch.
Instead of jumping *all in*, I decided to build a tech-demo / prototype first, release it,
iterate on it, and then potentially, use the same tech and create the *full blown* game I had
in mind.

This is where **Nexeh** comes into play. Initially, I wanted to build it exclusively while
streaming on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/coderguy) which sort of didn't work out, but I do want
*rectify* that next year and stream some game development more often.

![](/media/games/nexeh_800.png)

This also gave me the chance to finally sit down and play around with
[emcripten](http://github.com/kripken/emscripten), as you can see it in the screenshot above.

I ended up creating a nice *custom shell* which looks pretty decent, I have to say.

What do I mean, when I say *old school first person shooter*? Well, first of all the "world"
is made of *true 3D geomery*, but everything else consists of *2D sprites*, or *billboards*
if you will and they always *face* in the player's view direction.

In addition to all this, you get attacked and potentially can get yourself killed within the first
minute of the game. No hand holding, no regenerating health or manna.

Obviously, there's more to it than what I just said above, but I'll try to talk about *specifics*
next year. Everything I described here should give you a sneak peek into what's about to come.

One thing that I really want to make clear, the *art direction* isn't going to be *pixel artsy* or
*cartoony*. At any rate, it's too early to talk about specifics regarding this matter, but I just wanted to
get that out there into the wilderness.

Also, for obvious reasons, *Nexeh* is going to have *nothing* in common in terms of *story* or
*setting* (locations, characters, etc.), with the actual *final game* I wanna build. I choose to do this, in order
to avoid false expectations and confusion.

My hopes are to procrastinate less and actually have something playable, sometime in **Q1** of next year.
Please keep in mind, this is a *project* that I work on in my *spare time*, it is not my **full time
job** (ATM), therefore, a great many factors will influence the amount of *progress* that I can achieve.

Once there's something playable, I'll reach out to some of my artsy friends and we'll figure out
the actual *art direction*, plus the general look and feel.

In the long term, the tech that I build for **Nexeh** is going to be *extracted* and then turned
into a standalone general purpose "open source" game and engine framework, called **Nixel**, but more about that
another time.

RU FLAG
-------
In the wake up all the madness that went down this year, I put together this little *page* where
one can drag a photo and the photo will get the colors of the Russian flag applied to it.

This is similar to the feature that exists within the realms of Facebook.

You can find out more about it over
[here](http://github.com/icebreaker/ru). If you just want to play it, you
can do so by clicking [here](/ru).

RU
--
I also started learning the Russian Alphabet more seriously, but I still find it absolutely
mind wrecking and therefore I did not make as much progress with it as I would have liked to.

**p = r, c = s**, .... gaaah, my gray cells are confused!

End
---
Well, pretty much that's it for this year. Tried to cover everything, *important*.

I am not really a *new years resolutions* kind of person and therefore I do not have a *list*,
however, here are some things that I'd like to do, given that everything goes right in the
coming year, without being *complete*, by any stretch of the imagination.

* post more often on this blog
* stream more [game development](http://twitch.tv/coderguy)
* successfully master the Russian Alphabet
* *finish* and release *Nexeh* (hopefully, this won't take an entire year, **sigh**)
* **new** workstation
* <s>Russian wife</s>
* <s>*lay the foundations* of a **grassroots** communist political party</s>

Until next time, as server said, **END OF LINE**.
