# 2024 July Retrospective

July also flew by like the north wind and of course I didn't exactly end up working too much on any of my gazillion side projects, which I am sure that you are sick and tired of reading about at this point.

## Kingdom Rush

I did end up buying the latest installment of the [Kingdom Rush][kingdomrush] franchise and played through it like I always do.

In the last few entries of the franchise, they really got the balancing just right to where it's not trivial but, it's also not frustrating so that one is tempted to try again without things feeling unfair.

## Rebel Moon: Director's Cut

I talked about [Rebel Moon][rebelmoon] before but I totally didn't expect or see the director's cut dropping so soon after the initial release.

Haven't had the chance to watch it yet, but it's definitely on my list. I said this before and I'll say it again that this should have been a series instead.

## s&box

[s&box][sandbox] is the spiritual successor to [Gary's Mod][garysmod]. It's been invite only up until relatively recently, but now there seems to be a publicly available [developer preview][developerpreview] of some sorts.

Personally, I see it more of a [Roblox][roblox] competitor than anything else.
