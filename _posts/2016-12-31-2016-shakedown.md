2016 Shakedown
==============
Another year is behind us and I am here once again posting a *summary* of what I've been *hacking*
on in my spare time, which translates to *evenings* and *weekends*.

This year was more of a *year of ideas* when it comes to my personal projects. I did not *release*
a great many things, but fiddled with various ideas and crystallized the road ahead.

To put things into perspective, here are some charts *generated* by [GitHub](http://github.com/icebreaker).

#### 2016 vs 2015
![](/media/github/2016.png)

![](/media/github/2015.png)

Menhir
------
[Menhir](http://github.com/icebreaker/menhir) is a simple puzzle game, the player's sole purpose is
to try to clear the *board* by utilizing *empty* spots.

This is modeled after a "board game", I really enjoyed in my childhood.

![](/media/games/menhir.png)

Special thanks go out to [Kenney "Asset" Jesus](http://kenney.nl) for the sprites.

If you want to try it out, you can do so by clicking [here](/menhir).

Fz2D
----
[Fz2D](http://github.com/icebreaker/fz2d) received a couple of more updates, and slowly but
surely getting closer to graduating from alpha into beta.

I'd like to add / wrap-up the following things next year:

- Fz2D.Camera (scrolling, etc)
- Built-in asset pipeline (texture and font atlas generation)
- Improved (painless) handling of dependencies

Feel free to take a peek at the documentation available over [here](http://mihail.co/fz2d/docs/).

nyan.c
------
This was a warm-up for [IOCCC](http://www.ioccc.org/), but then it turned out that there was no
competition held this year. Oh well ....

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(){const char *O_o[]=/*msz*/{
" ,------,\n"  "v|   /\\__/\\ \n"
" |__( ^ w ^) \n" "     \"  \"\n",
	     " ,------,\n"
	     "~|    /\\__/\\\n"
	     " |___( ^ w ^) \n"
	     "     \"  \"\n",
" ,------,\n" "^|    /\\__/\\\n"
" |___( ^ w ^) \n"	"     \"  \"\n" };
int i=1;for(;;){printf("%s\x1b[4A",
O_o[(i=(i+1)%3)]);usleep(200000);}}
```

ZeeCraft
--------
Added an **HD** mode to my [ZeeCraft](http://github.com/icebreaker/zeecraft) project.

![](/media/games/zeecraft_hd.png)

Special thanks, once again go out to [Kenney "Asset" Jesus](http://kenney.nl) for the textures.

fastopen.vim
------------
I made a few updates to [fastopen.vim](http://github.com/icebreaker/fastopen.vim). A quick
"file opener" for [vim](http://www.vim.org) using "dmenu".

![](/media/2015/fastopen.png)

JSIP
----
[JSIP](http://github.com/icebreaker/jsip) can *pack* a piece of JS into a plain PNG image. Does not rely
on any *custom chunks* or other exploits.

#### input: helloworld.js

```javascript
alert('hello world');
```

#### output: helloworld.html

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Helloworld</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQAAAAABCAAAAAAUMi+rAAAAIUlEQVR42mNI
zEktKtFQz0jNyclXKM8vyklR17RWGDkAAJWCJK98ao+pAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC
"
         style="visibility: hidden; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;"
         onload="this.remove(); var c=document.createElement('canvas').getContext('2d'); c.canvas.width=this.width; c.canvas.height=this.height; c.drawImage(this,0,0); var p=c.getImageData(0,0,this.width,this.height).data; var s='';for(var i=0;i<p.length;i+=4)s+=String.fromCharCode(p[i]); (1,eval)(s);" onerror="this.remove();" />
  </body>
</html>
```

Even with the *indirect* eval, the resulting *code* is slower than the same *code* included and
executed directly; but it was a fun thing to experiment with, nonetheless.

To view a *non-interactive* visual demo produced by JSIP, click [here](/jsip).

Noty
----
Noty is a small *note* taking application, I written in pure bash script. It's roughly 200 lines long,
including comments and stores notes in [GFM](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

It is possible to store all notes in a user specified location by exporting the `NOTY_DB` variable
in your `.bashrc` like so:

```bash
export NOTY_DB=$HOME/Dropbox/.noty
```

The command line interface is really simple.

```bash
Noty v1.0.0

usage: noty command [arg] [note]

commands:
  c - create a new note
  l - list notes
  m - mark a note
  u - unmark a note
```

A little example is in order to demonstrate how lean and mean it is to use.

```bash
 ~ $ noty c 'hello world'
Initialized 'testdb' ...
Initialized '2016-12-30' ...
Added note 'hello world' ...
 ~ $ noty l
2016-12-30
----------
1. [ ] hello world
 ~ $ noty c 'make cake'
Added note 'make cake' ...
 ~ $ noty m 1
Marked note '1' ...
 ~ $ noty l
2016-12-30
----------
1. [x] hello world
2. [ ] make cake
```

SteamSpy
--------
If you like to *spy* on Steam games a lot like I do, then you might find the bookmarklet
or the TamperMonkey script below very very useful.

#### Bookmarklet
Open SteamSpy on any Steam store page with a single click.

```javascript
javascript:window.open(window.location.href.replace('store.steampowered', 'steamspy'))
```

#### TamperMonkey Script
This *script* adds a *SteamSpy* button to every Steam store page.

![](/media/games/nomanssky_steamspy.png)

```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         SteamSpy
// @namespace    http://mihail.co

(function() {
    'use strict';
    var el = document.querySelector('.apphub_OtherSiteInfo');
    if(!el) return;

    var a = el.querySelector('a');
    if(!a) return;

    var newa = a.cloneNode(true);
    newa.href = 'javascript: window.open("https://steamspy.com' + a.href.match(/\/app\/([0-9]+)/)[0] + '");';

    var text = newa.querySelector('span');
    if(!text) return;

    text.innerHTML = 'Steam Spy';

    el.appendChild(newa);
})();
```

Hamunaputra
-----------
Hamunaputra started as a 32KB room-based *roguelite* for DOS, written in plain 16-bit
ASM, with everything being *packed* into a single *.COM* executable. No external files,
or dependencies of any kind.

![](/media/games/hamunaputra.png)

Never finished it, and currently sits in the back burner.

Nexeh & Nixel
-------------
This has been my primary focus this year, and will continue to be next year.
Like I mentioned before, I would like to build and old-school first person shooter,
retaining as many *original* elements as possible, while at the same time throwing a couple
of new twists into the mix for good measure.

My definition of old-school includes (but not limited to), games like:

- DOOM
- Hexen and Heretic
- Duke Nukem 3D
- Painkiller
- Shadow Warrior

![](/media/games/shadow_warrior_bunnies.png)

I want to go for the 2.5D look, with 3D world geometry and 2D sprite based
(billboard) entities. Haven't settled for a general look and feel yet, because I am still working
on some of the core tech.

![](/media/games/nexeh.gif)

... with some *sprites* ripped from Hexen ...

![](/media/games/nexeh_ripped.gif)

... and compiled with [emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/) ...

![](/media/games/nexeh_2016.png)

I managed to figure out most of the architectural questions; will try to blog about some of the
technical *stuff* in the weeks to come. Stay tuned.

Like I promised, it's all going to be *open source* when it comes to the *code* and *tech*.
When am I going to open source it? Well, that remains to be seen, but most likely only after
I have something more or less playable in my hands.

Greed
-----
Stumbled upon [In Pursuit of Greed](http://www.redshadowsoftware.com/projects/greed) and
decided to modernize and port it, keeping the *original* software renderer intact, while
allowing for higher resolutions, both *upscaled* (from 320x200) and native.

![](/media/games/greed_poster.png)

Here you can see a screenshot of the game running at *whopping* 800x600 resolution.

![](/media/games/greed.png)

This is still very much work in progress, and I work on it every once in a while, but we'll
get there sooner or later.

Writings
--------
There is plenty of *literature* when it comes to *game development*, but none of it is focusing
on the actual so called **practical** side of things. There are *bits* scattered here and there,
but nothing exhaustive or conclusive.

Most of the books, just rehash and regurgitate the very same things, perhaps *updated* or
*modernized* in places, but still presented in rather outdated formats.

To change the status quo, I started *sketching* out three books, *Software Rendering for the
practical game developer*, *Game programming for the practical game developer* and a companion
guide entitled, *Mathematics for the practical game developer*.

I want to focus purely on the *practical side* of things, avoid *platitudes* and *urban myths*, however,
when any of these will turn into actual *paper* that one can hold in their hands, one again, it
remains to be seen ...

On a different note, there's still considerable interest in my [FloppyBird](/floppybird) project, which
means that it's time for me to write a *Making of Floppy Bird*, sometime next year ...

Pyramid Hologram
----------------
Before I even get started, yes, yes, yes, it's not a *real hologram*, but it's still 10x more
interesting than the idiotic thing we call **VR**. Who on Earth wants to stick half a kilogram of
equipment on their head? Apparently quite a few. Good luck with destroying your eyesight faster
than a good old CRT would.

Now that we have that settled, let me dive into the details.

The so called *"DYI holograms"* have been circulating on the Internets for quite some time, but all
efforts seem to be focused on *displaying* animations, instead of *real-time* applications, like
video games.

{% include youtube.html id="nvJ70BThiHc" %}

Basically, you build a *pyramid* and then you use a *tablet* or another device to *project* on it by
placing it on the top, you can see this in action in the video above.

![](/media/2016/hologram_pyramid.png)

*(Source: [~mhsung](http://myweb.fcu.edu.tw/~mhsung/NPDP/Tech/Papercraft/PC_EX20.htm))*

In order to *achieve* the effect, one has to *prepare* a special *video*, which you can see below.

{% include youtube.html id="TcUHV6bHOeg" %}

What's really going on here? The answer is really simple. It's the same *thing* rendered from 4 different
angles, which is then *reflected* on the 4 sides of the pyramid, giving the *illusion* of a volumetric
hologram.

Do you see where this is going? When it comes to *games*, all one has to do is *render* in real time
the *visible scene* from 4 different angles, by rotating the so called *camera*.

Isn't that expensive, to render *almost* the same thing 4 times? Well, it really depends on a couple of
things like: complexity of the scene, output resolution and overall graphical fidelity.

I want to build a prototype with something relatively *simple*, like *Tux Racer*. Take a look at the
small *sketch* I made to illustrate the concept, in order to put things into perspective.

![](/media/2016/hologram_pyramid_sketch.png)


In many respects this is similar to *split screen local couch co-op*, where the *screen* is split into
2 to 4 individual viewports giving each player the ability to roam around freely.

##### Left 4 Dead 2

![](/media/games/left4dead2coop.png)


##### Super Mario Kart

![](/media/games/smccoop.png)

Imagine sitting at a table and each player seeing the very same world from a different *view*. Wouldn't
that be super duper cool? I'll let you decide ...

Rover
-----
Even though Elon Musk is very very optimistic when it comes to colonizing Mars, and yes he is definitely
going to *democratize* the *rocket* business, but we are very very far away from *man* setting foot on
Mars.

NASA got their *rover* moving around, snapping a few photos here and there, but every time something
*interesting* pops-up on one of those photos, they always seem to be very eager to discredit it or just
blatantly ignore it.

I fully understand, you can't just move around a few billion dollars worth of machinery, willy nilly, as you please.
I get that 100%, but when there's considerable doubt when it comes to *certain* geological features that appear
to resemble *man-made* structures or statues, the silence and the same old same charade becomes quite annoying.

Nobody is saying that every *rock formation* that looks suspicious is a statue or some relic left there
by some ancient civilization, but all it would take is to move closer to one instance and take a closer
photo. That's all it would take, and then all the crazy conspiracy theorists would just shut up and
crawl back into the caves they emerged from.

I've been thinking about this, what if, we could create an *inexpesive* machine which could roam around
freely, with its sole purpose being taking high resolution close-up photographs of certain points of
interests.

![](/media/2016/rover.png)

A few details about the *sketch* above:

- in terms of scale, it should be the size of a regular *sitting ball*
- the outer *shell* rotates around the inner *shell*
- the inner *shell* is always axis aligned, regardless of the outer *shell*
- 3 solar panels, which means that two of them will receive *sunlight* regardless of the rotation
of the outer *shell*
- the inner *shell* contains a *black-box* with all the *equipment* (camera, comm-link, a mini PC, etc)
- the outer shell should absorb any *shock* (i.e when *landing*)

I am pretty sure that there are *many* things that I didn't think of, or things that are just plain wrong
or impossible with such a *design*, but the general idea would be to build a dozen of these and then
let them loose on the surface or Mars. Each of these could *visit* a place of interest and send back
high resolution photographs.

Since it wouldn't contain any *expensive* scientific equipment the building costs should be minimal,
compared the rovers that have been deployed in the past.

SketchFab
---------
A couple of my favorite [*sketchfabs*](https://sketchfab.com/theicebreaker/likes).

End

*Phew*, if you managed reach **THE END**, you are as brave as you are foolish. All in all, it has been
an interesting year, like I mentioned above, my main focus for 2017 is going to be my old school first
person shooter project. It would be nice to reach some sort of a *playable* tech-demo state, sooner
rather than later.

Since I am not a *console* gamer, my new years resolutions cannot be as simple as *720p*, I hope that
you can understand that. **(PC MASTER RACE FOR LIFE REPRESENT)**

Oh, I almost forgot, mostly because I've been rambling for so long, my game of the year, **IS** most definitely,
without a shadow of a doubt, *silence and drum rolls*, [Firewatch](http://www.firewatchgame.com/).

![](/media/games/firewatch.png)

To view all the photos I took in-game, click [here](https://firewatch.camera/EvergreenTwoForksFirs/).

[Jane Ng](https://twitter.com/thatjaneng) and the rest of the team did an amazing job when it comes
to crafting the *world* of Firewatch.
