2021 Retrospective
==================
As the 671th day of 2020 is finally drawing to a close, we find ourselves at the
turn of yet another page, which promises nothing but misery and sorrow. Crows
feeding on thousands of corpses hanging upside down. Oh wait a second, this is
the introduction of a rather different post of mine, just unread that please,
it's too late to delete it now.

On a more serious note, let us take awe a gander at the traditional
_year-in-review_ commit chart, graciously generated by none other than the
mighty GitHub and let the data speak for itself.

![](/media/github/2021.png)

The avid readers of this blog, or rather the more observant ones, will
immediately notice how number of contributions is significantly lower compared
to previous years. And what is the reason for that? Well, the explanation is
rather simple I'm afraid, it's the simple fact that I managed to put in a lot
fewer hours into my various side projects.

Those of you who happen to know me personally in some capacity, also will surely
know that I always have a number of side projects that I am actively working on
at any give time. It is almost like an endless queue of ideas that are yet to be
realized and unleashed into the world. That reminds me that I really have to
clean up my repositories (144!) on GitHub, because things are getting out of
hand.

OLEN Games
----------
While I got a lot less done this past year, I did manage to complete a couple of
research cycles when it comes to two of my most important projects of which you
heard me babble over the years in various of forms and incarnations.

What am I speaking of? The portable 2D/3D game engine and framework, and more
recently the self-contained portable build automation tool designed for projects
primarily written in C/C++.

These two bad boys are at the top of my totem pole, and in 2021 I finally
managed to figure out the direction, style and general scope of them. My great
hope for 2022 is to make some serious headway on both, instead of my traditional
style of it's done, when it's done.

This is where [OLEN Games][olengames] is going to come into play as an umbrella
of sorts, which will let me separate these two (and more!) bad boys from the
rest of my experimental work and put them into more of a front-and-center
position so to speak.

[![](/media/misc/olen_white.png)](https://olen.games)

Having an umbrella like this has the added benefit of simplifying the process of
naming things. How do people even name their children? In my case, I will just
roll with **OLEN Engine** and **OLEN Build**. Tada! Naming crisis graciously averted.

I always tend of blabber on and on about technology, but I am building most of
it in order to finally be able to build a proper game or two in the near future.
Building an engine, without building any games in-house with it, is a very very
dangerous and ill advised thing to do, and I highly recommend anyone against
going down that path of treachery, it will not lead anywhere good!

A long overdue face-flit
------------------------
After many moons of rolling with the same super basic design of this blog, I
finally decided that it was about time to give it a well deserved face-lift as
well as _migrate_ it back to [Jekyll][jekyll].

A number of years ago I was looking for an excuse to write something non-trivial
in Python and the result of that was the static site generator, that I eventually
ended up calling [doxter][doxter].

Once doxter was ready for prime-time I migrated this blog from Jekyll to it. And
now the natural question is why migrate away from it and back to Jekyll again?
Since that time Jekyll and GitHub made a wide array of changes, and GitHub Pages
got even better, therefore I felt like going native again would be good idea.

It remains to be seen if/when I'll regret this decision in the months to come.

[doxter][doxter] is still out there and perfectly usable. It withstood the test
of time, even going from python 2.x to 3.x without any backbreaking changes or
fuss, which is isn't something totally unexpected, considering the fact that I
am the second best programmer that has ever lived. I'll let you discover who is
the very first one, but I am sure it has to do with a temple and an operating
system of some description or another. What a weird combination, right? Totally!

In other, very much related news, decided to keep the **RSS feed** alive,
despite the fact that many consider **RSS** to be long dead at this point in
time. Of course, if you happen to be reading this in your favorite RSS reader,
then the so called **facelift** that I've been babbling about above will make
absolutely no sense to you, and perhaps that is how things should be in life,
wouldn't you agree?

Also, I took the time and made the blog more mobile friendly, so it is now
enjoyable on your extremely precious mobile phone or tablet, even though it's
highly unlikely that one would be consuming anything I write on this blog that
way.

And now without any further ado, let us take a deep dive into the actual
projects and experiments that I have hacked on during the course of this rather
ghastly past year.

WoWiconify
----------
[WoWiconify][wowiconify] was the result of some super duper impromptu coding
session, without too much thought and thinking put into it, but the results
turned out to be fairly decent and interesting.

Let me loop and ease you into what it actually is, and start the conversation
off with a couple of images, which I am told they are supposed to be worth
not less and not a whole lot more than exactly a thousand words.

Considering this was told to me before NFTs were a thing, I consider it one of
the few core truths of our existence.

### Input
![](/media/2021/wowiconifyinput.png)

### Output
![](/media/2021/wowiconifyoutput.png)

What is going on? Well, it is a small command line tool that takes an input
image and a number (up to a maximum of 512, which is a totally arbitrary limit) of
spell icons from WoW (World of Warcraft), and produces an output image that uses
those said spell icons to approximate the original input image.

It's only a handful of lines of C and uses a couple of [single file libraries][stb]
by [Sean Barett][nothings] with no other dependencies.

Considering that this is merely a toy project, I do not provide any pre-compiled
binaries, but if you want to check out the source code and perhaps even compile
it yourself, then feel free to click right [here][wowiconify].

Legend of Grimrock 2: Multiplayer uMod
--------------------------------------
That is a mouthful isn't it?

Last year in December the so called **uMod** support has landed in a special
**nutcracker** beta branch of Legend of Grimrock 2 on Steam, in the form of a Lua
source code drop and the ability to execute Lua in an **unsandboxed**
fashion, which allows mods more or less unrestricted access to the main Lua
state and can combined with the source code drop can be used to **monkey-patch**
almost anything within the game.

This also allows one to create a completely new game in an entirely different
genre. In other words, the possibilities are truly endless in terms of what one
could do with it, so long all changes/modifications still abide by the [modding
and asset usage terms][modding].

I knew about this and I took a quick glance at it right when it was dropped by
[Petri Häkkinen][petri] from [Almost Human][almosthuman], but then as the new
year came about it completely fell of my radar and forgot about it.

Since I take a yearly sabbatical every year in December, by taking the entire
month off, I decided to take another look at it and see if I could leverage it
to add some sort of drop-in co-op multiplayer support, which would allow two
players to play both the main official campaign of the game as well as the
myriad of user created custom dungeons. Obviously this doesn't exclude the
possibility of creating more co-op multiplayer focused dungeons either, it's
just that it must work with existing content.

After a few days of rather intense experimentation I came up with what can be
seen in the video below.

{% include youtube.html id="79XWMO5O2TM" %}

I am not going to go into any of the technical details, nor release any of the
underlying code just yet. Why? For two very good and perfectly valid reasons,
which I am going to unpack below.

First of all, I don't want to get ahead of myself until I am absolutely certain that I
can pull this off in the manner that I just described above.

And second, the **nutcracker** beta branch of the game that enables **uMod**
support is still kept hush-hush and low profile by the developers for the time being,
and I don't want to unnecessarily rock the proverbial boat just yet so to speak.

Besides, the entire journey will warrant a proper brain-dump type of a technical
post, where I intend to take a deep dive into how it was all done, considering
that there's a treasure trove of things to talk about.

Fit for Autopsy
---------------
One of my favorite pastime activities is taking an existing code-base and
attempting to port it to the web via the means of [WASM][wasm] by leveraging
[Emscripten][emcc].

This year's victim happened to be [Fit for Autopsy][fitforautopsy], which is a
**demopack** or **demo anthology** by [Fit][fit].

It seemed like a **natural fit**, pun intended, and was already portable and
compile-able on a number of platforms.

Now it did had a few remnants of good old fashioned OpenGL fixed function
pipeline in some of the renderer, which I hoped that I could just keep as-is and
have the fixed function pipeline emulation present in Emscripten handle.

Well, it kind of worked, but it definitely doesn't render everything correctly,
which means that I'll have to rewrite some of the renderer, which is not too
bad.

You can watch a very much work-in-progress-wasm-port version of the demo called [Boy][boy]
from the demopack over [here][playboy].

Another WASM/Emscripten related project that I hacked on was a small tile-map
editor written in C and using only the 2D `<canvas>` context to draw everything
without utilizing WebGL directly.

{% include video.html src="/media/2021/editor.mp4" %}

Before you ask, for this particular experiment I ended up **borrowing** the assets
from [Catacomb Snatch][cas].

I would also really like to port something of a higher or rather bigger caliber
like [Penumbra Overture][penumbraoverture] or [Shadowgrounds][shadowgrounds],
but I have not managed to work up the courage just yet, considering that both of
those would require a complete rewrite of their renderer and more before they
could be even considered for porting anywhere.

js13kGames
----------
The yearly [js13kGames][js13k] competition is part and parcel of my yearly
collection of well defined rituals. This year hasn't been any different, and I
attempted to come up with something that is not totally uninteresting, yet it can
fit into a paltry 13 kilo bytes after being compressed.

Unlike other years, I did manage to come up with a fairly decent idea in my
honest and humble opinion, but like always didn't manage to push it over the
finish line, due to lack of time, etc. One day!

The idea itself, while not anything super revolutionary, but a tiny procedurally
generated space gardening game, where the player has to tend to the plants on
the planet and collect enough raw material to open the teleporter, which takes
them to the next randomly generated planet. All this while fending off a flying
enemy that also wants and likes the raw materials and desperately would like to
collect them; also whenever it encounters the player, it will attempt to steal
its raw materials as well as water, which is a scarce resource.

Perhaps, I'll come back to this idea and turn it into reality one day, given
that nobody beats me to it before, that is!

QOI
---
A couple of weeks ago, [Dominic Szablewski][phoboslab] has announced a completely
new image file format called [QOI][qoi], which needless to say has gotten quite a lot
of attention as well as traction among like minded peoples of the internet.

I didn't want to miss such an historic moment, the birth of a completely new
image file format is quite a big event. So, as any good law abiding citizen
would, I decided to make my contribution in the form of a so called [gdk pixbuf
loader][gdkpixbufloader], the source code of which can be found over
[here][qoipixbufloader].

![](/media/2021/qoipixbufloader.png)

This allows existing GTK applications to load/save and generate thumbnails for
images in the QOI image format, which turns the format into more of a first
class citizen in the world of applications built with GTK; which is a
significant amount of applications in the linux ecosystem.

As this was thrown together in mere three days it definitely needs some rigorous
testing, and there might be some bugs lurking in the shadows due to perhaps not
handling some corner cases, but all in all it's usable and gets the job done.

Building loaders is totally under-documented and an obscure process, it made me
realize how arcane and in many ways broken this entire system is. It's to the
point of requiring its very own separate and dedicated post in order to fully
document and chronicle my experience, but that's a story for another time.

Gemini on the Go
----------------
I mentioned Go during my [2020 retrospective][retro] and expressed my desire to
write something non-trivial using it in order to be able to evaluate its merits,
weaknesses and most importantly where and how it fits into my tool-belt.

Two months ago or so, I stumbled upon the [Gemini][gemini] internet protocol.

> Gemini is a new internet protocol which:
> * Is heavier than gopher
> * Is lighter than the web
> * Will not replace either
> * Strives for maximum power to weight ratio
> * Takes user privacy very seriously

What shocked me the most is that I never heard about it until that very moment
in time.

Just like with [QOI][qoi], it's not an very day event to witness the birth of a
brand new internet protocol like this, so once again I wanted to leave my mark
and make my contribution.

As a result, I started building a very tiny Gemini server and client combination
in the form a command line utility in Go.

Once it's ready, will use it to power and run my own Gemini capsule, which I
intend to host on a [Digital Ocean][digitalocean] droplet.

This is really the perfect type of an application for Go, and will allow me to
delve into some of the flagship features that set Go apart, like Goroutines,
networking and so on.

You can expect a dedicated post in which I will wholeheartedly dissect my
experience and perhaps even shell out some totally unsolicited advice for good
measure.

Aren't there plenty if existing Gemini servers and clients? Oh, there are
plenty, in fact one might go as far as saying that there's rather healthy and
active ecosystem built around it already.

One of my favorite GUI based Gemini clients' is [Lagrange][lagrange].

![](/media/2021/lagrange.png)

The word client might be a misnomer, **browser** is probably a way better term
to describe it.

A great question that you must be asking yourself right now is who exactly
might be the target audience of such a niche internet protocol? And that is an
extremely good question, which I'll try to explain in the way I see it.

From where I stand, there are three distinct groups of peeps using Gemini at
this point in time.

First, let's just call the them the **old timers**, the ones who got to live
through the hey-day of BBSes or at least were teenagers or perhaps young adults
during those golden days of glory. They always reminisce those days and have
an ardent desire to relive them in one way or another. Need not to be said
that this group is totally unsatisfied and annoyed by what the so called modern
**web** has become.

The second group, which I proudly include myself in, is the group that missed
the BBS days or got only a minuscule taste of them due to timing and/or other
reasons and always longed to experience it in its almost raw form.

Last but, not least, the third group is composed of children of the modern
world, the outcasts, desperately seeking a quiet place away from the neon
lights of the metropolis; for them, something like Gemini is like sanctuary
and invokes a feeling that is somewhat weirdly familiar, but totally foreign
at the same time.

The great ZIGgurat
------------------
[Zig][zig] is yet another contender in the relatively new and very shiny languages
that ought to replace C/C++ in one form or another within our natural life times.

I am not terribly interested or impressed by the language itself. How should I
put it best? It's way too avant-garde for my humble needs and desires when it
comes to languages.

However, this is not a critique of the merits or shortcomings of the language
itself, but rather the toolchain that powers it under the hood.

As most languages these days Zig leverages the LLVM toolchain (which clang is
part of) to do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to bootstrapping and so
forth.

As a direct result of this, it comes with a fully functional C/C++ compiler
hidden under the hood. Well, hidden until Zig's creator, a good lad known as
[Andrew Kelley][akelly], decided to pull off the hood and expose it in the form
of [zig cc][zigcc].

[zig cc][zigcc] is a wrapper over the LLVM toolchain under the hood and
provides some additional features on top that aren't available if one would go
with the native toolchain.

This is all fine and dandy, however before one could use it a true
drop-in-replacement for gcc and/or clang it still needed at least two more
things in my book.

First, it needed `ar` to be exposed as well in order for one to be able to
create static libraries and then a windows resource file compiler,
colloquially known as `windres` in the world of mingw based cross compiler.

`ar` was eventually exposed as [zig ar][zigar], which left `windres` as the
last piece of the puzzle.

Once again as a citizen of the free world, I took upon myself the task of
adding `windres`, unfortunately I failed to boostrap the zig compiler itself
and after a few days I set it aside and put this project into the back-burner.

There have been a few zig releases since then and I intend to take another
stab at it during the course of next year. But once again, I shall not many
any premature promises!

Living life on a Vim
--------------------
Give a man a Vim plugin and you solve one of his problems. Teach a man how to
write Vim plugins and he'll write one to solve every single one of his problems.
I don't remember exactly how that goes, but it should be something that is
pretty close to those lines.

I always tell people who are considering ramping up and switching to Vim is
that unlike with other editors the entire thing is a process and it cannot
happen over night, due to every single one of us having a quite different as
well as needs in order to be what we ultimately end up calling productive.

In my any ways it's as much as about the journey as it is about the
destination, in terms of identifying some sort of an inefficiency in your very
own workflow and way of using vim and then looking for a way to correct it.
Just like with most things that matter in life, there's always a better way
and that happens to be no different when it comes to Vim.

[Bram Moolenaar] the creator and benevolent dictator for life of Vim, happens
to have a very good presentation touching upon this very subject of
identifying one's inefficiencies, finding better ways and then turning those
into habits.

{% include youtube.html id="eX9m3g5J-XA" %}

It's quite dated at this point, but everything said in there still holds up
pretty well to this very day.

You might be thinking that you didn't sign up for a lecture about Vim when you
started reading this post and here I am preaching you like a true evangelist,
gospels about effective text editing in Vim.

Fear not, that is not my intention, I just want to give an update or two about
about some changes in my own and very personal Vim world.

I made some improvements to my Vim plugin called [fastopen][fastopen], which allows
one to fuzzy search and open files within a directory by leveraging
[dmenu][dmenu] and Git if the user happens to be editing within the confines
of a Git repository. With these changes in place the root of the repository is
now properly detected no matter from which sub-directory the user might have
started Vim to edit a particular set of files.

Ended up improving the Git repository detection, for which of course I rely on the
presence of the excellent Git integration Vim plugin called
[fugitive][fugitive] by none other than the absolute legend himself, talking
about [Tim Pope][tpope] of course. He's probably one of (if not) the most
prolific Vim plugin authors out there.

Now that Vim 8 has been out there for a while, I'd like to make an experiment
and see if I could use the built-in popup menu support to display the list of
files instead of shelling out to an external tool like dmenu, but that's a
experiment for another day.

Speaking of dmenu, it also happens to be yet another utility on my apparently
ever growing list of tools that I'd very much like to replace with my own.

Fantastic Urges and How to Control Them
---------------------------------------
No, this is not a new novel fresh out of the oven by our beloved J.K Rowling,
nor it is a campaign by PornHub, but rather me resisting the urge of writing my
very own X11 window manager among other things, from scratch no less.

In 2020 I decided that enough is enough and wrote my very own terminal
emulator from scratch called [marmota][marmota]. I didn't go completely off
the hook and ended up using [vte][libvte] under the hood, but everything
around it in terms of features and capabilities has been built keeping my own
particular and not so particular needs in mind.

Why would I do that? I grew sick and tired of the constant breakage, ad-hoc
feature addition, removals or simply changes in existing behavior of the
existing terminal emulators out there, many of whom do use vte under the hood
as well.

So, I've been using it without a hitch until earlier this year, when after an
update, miraculously my fonts were no longer being hinted properly in the
terminal.

At first I though that it must be some distribution level change that has
happened and perhaps they re-calibrated the hinting priorities and such and
thought that it will get addressed in no time.

However, as time went on, new updates were flowing in but my fonts were in the
terminal were still looking absolutely horrendous. Now, I was starting to get
suspicious a little bit and after some digging managed to locate the culprit.

It was indeed a [change][vteissue] in vte itself, which has been partially
reverted, but never ever restored the previous totally sane and valid
behavior.

And now here I am contemplating ditching vte and rolling my own, which is a
ridiculous thing to do, I admit as much and potentially quite a bit of work,
but I am at an age where I can no longer take such absolute nonsense.

And what about writing my X11 window manager? Well, considering that I already
rolled my own terminal, might as well ditch my current window manager which
happens to be [Openbox][openbox] and roll my own.

That would make me only one or two steps away from my own distribution. I guess
we'll have to live and see what the future holds and where the four winds take
us.

Oh, with all the commotion I almost forgot about the glorious day when all of
the sudden my GNOME Keyring broke due to a [change][glib] in the name of
security to GLib itself.

With all that said the natural and rather ugly question does rear its ugly
head. Can you guess what that question is?

**Could 2021 misterously been the year of the Linux Desktop at last?**

The answer to that rather most outrageous and ridiculous question according
to ancient atrolinux theorists is a resounding and most definite **NO**.

Let us just leave it at that, shall we? Some things are better to be left
unspoken.

> _**GNOME dēlenda est!**_

P.I.M.P My Desktop
------------------
It's been a while since I made any major changes to the look and feel of my
desktop. It is a sign of my age? Perhaps.

After more than a decade I decided to switch my cursor theme from [Comix
Cursors][comix] to [Bibata][bibata] and I'm more than happy to report that
I've never been happier.

As far as monospaced fonts suitable for coding are concerned, I celebrated my
second year anniversary with the rather excellent [JetBrains Mono][jetbrainsmono].

The End
-------
This is the end. I do hope that some of this resonated with it and if it did
you can find the paid extended version below by subscribing to my onlyfarmers
profile.

Not a big fan of new years' resolutions myself, which is not terribly
surprising considering that fact that I am not really a big tea person myself.

Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to end this rather lengthy retrospective
with some sort of a list of it-would-be-nice-to-do for the rather ghastly
upcoming year:

- have some showcase-able builds of OLEN Build and OLEN Engine
- continue working on the Legend of Grimrock 2 multiplayer uMod
- live stream some [coding sessions][twitch] at least twice a week on Twitch;
during the weekend of course
- upload the VODs of said streams to my YouTube [channel][youtube] in order to
start building an audience over there
- reach a 1000 followers on [Twitter][twitter]
- write a retrospective post every single month; no excuses or exceptions
- get married and have quadruplets

Until next time as the great and eternal server once said to me: **END OF LINE**.

P.S: Make sure that you do not have a patchy log server somewhere in your
basement.

P.S.S: If you didn't get that joke, it is time for you to retire and pick up
gardening or carpeting.
