2019 Retrospective
==================
Here I am again, writing up this year's retrospective on the last day of the
year no less.

As per usual, let's kick this off by sharing the mandatory
**"last year in commits"** chart generated by GitHub.

![][0]

Async Totem
-----------
[Async Totem][1] is a lean and mean async command runner for Vim 8 and later.

The reasons for me writing this plugin are two fold. First, I thought that it
was about time for me to check out the *async* job support in Vim 8, and second
I wanted to write a simple plugin leveraging it.

With that said, what better plugin to write than an async command runner?

Also, it's worth noting that it's **125** lines of vimscript (including the
comments).

What was my general impression? It's perfectly usable and just like all the
*extra* features added on the top of Vim over the years, it does one thing
only and it does it well, nothing else to comment, really!

Sobinka
-------
I mentioned Sobinka, the general purpose 2D immediate mode *game engine*
last year; while I still didn't release it to the general public yet,
did manage to figure out and even **freeze** some of the existing
user (developer) facing API.

There's still some discovery and experimentation to be done when it
comes to nailing down the *initial* API that would be included for
the v1.0.0 release, however, enough of it has been *defined* where
I can start using it to sketch out some of the game ideas that I've
been toying around with lately.

My plan is to wrap it up and release it sometime next year, but not before,
I have at least one _game prototype_ of my own up and running, which I can
use to profile things in more or less *real life* scenarios.

I know that I said this last year, but I'll attempt to blog about it in 2020,
and go into some of the technical and architectural decisions I've taken
while designing it. Nothing super duper revolutionary, but I do think that
there are a couple of things lurking there that worth talking about.

13kjsgames
----------
I made an attempt at coming up with something for the [13kjsgames][2]
competition (or game jam if you will), but sadly, I couldn't finish my
entry in time, and later I just put the project into the back burner for
now.

Nevertheless, let me share a *small gif* showcasing the *project*.

.dotfiles
---------
This year, I also simplified a lot of my dotfiles and colorschemes, as well
as removed some Vim plugins that I wasn't really getting all that much out
of at the end of the day. I like to do this from time to time and try to
get by with the bare minimum, without sacrificing customizability or
flexibility.

As far as fonts are concerned, I am still rolling with the excellent
[IBM Plex Mono][4]. If you are looking for a fresh and new monospaced
font for the New Year, you should most definitely check it out!

Until next time, as server said, **END OF LINE**.
