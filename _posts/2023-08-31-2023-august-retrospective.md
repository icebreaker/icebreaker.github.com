2023 August Retrospective
=========================

As a Vim aficionado, I was totally surprised and shocked to learn about the sudden passing of [**Bram Moolenar**][bram], at the beginning of this month.

This means that [**Vim 9**][vim9] is probably the last and definitive version of Vim, considering that it's not clear who will be the next [**BDFL**][bdfl] to take the helms of development. In fact, it's highly likely that there won't be another [**BDFL**][bdfl] at all, which is even more terrifying, if you ask me.

In other news, this August also marked one year since the disappearance of [Our Machinery][ourmachinery]. I never talked about it earlier, because I felt that it would be in poor taste, but now that a year has passed, I thought that I'd mention it. We still don't know of course what has transpired and one can only theorize. But, if you ask me, some sort of legal trouble would be my personal best guess.

Alas, I didn't get to play or work much on any of my side projects, but I do have some pretty cool stuff cooking in the proverbial oven, one of them being the build system that I've mentioned and talked about in various forms in the past. Would be nice to release an experimental version of it before the end of the year. We'll see how things go, not going to make any hard promises yet.
