2014 Shakedown
==============
It's been a quite long time since I discussed anything on this blog.

One could say that I neglected it, which is not an entirely accurate
claim, but it's not very far from the truth.

I do have a bunch of ideas to write posts about, but most of them
would conflict with my basic rule of three: _No sex, politics or religion_ on the blog.

Anyways, all is well, _2014_ has been a year where I released quite a few open
source projects.

I will talk about some of my _work-in-progress-not-yet-open-source_ projects in
a series of separate posts starting next year.

Please note, the projects listed below are not in chronological order of their release date.

Oh, and by the way, I didn't get married.
